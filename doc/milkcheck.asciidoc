MILKCHECK CONFIGURATION
-----------------------
*Milkcheck's* configuration file is located in */etc/milkcheck/milkcheck.conf*.

In this file you can specify the *SERVICE CONFIGURATION* directory, fanout and all available default options.

=== Configuration file example ===
.....
# cat /etc/milkcheck/milkcheck.conf
#
# Configuration directory
# This directory should contain yaml configuration files
config_dir: /etc/milkcheck/conf

# Default fanout connection for any service
fanout: 64

# Actions names that reverse dependencies (usually, 'start' uses the standard dependencies and 'stop' uses the reversed ones)
reverse_actions: ['stop']

# Do not display summary by default (True/False)
summary: False
.....

SERVICE CONFIGURATION
-----------------------
All *Milkcheck* services and actions are defined in a configuration directory located by default in */etc/milkcheck/conf*.

In this directory you can have one or more configuration files describing services, groups and actions to perform.

The syntax of theses files is YAML compliant and looks like :
......
$ cat /etc/milkcheck/conf/cron.yaml
#
# Local service
#
# This service will run "service crond status" command on specified target when
# "status" action is called.
#
services:
    cron:
        target: node[1-100]
        actions:
            status:
                cmd: /sbin/service crond status
......

The *SERVICE CONFIGURATION* files must have the '.yaml' suffix to be parsed by *milkcheck*.

EXAMPLES
--------
*milkcheck* status::
    Launch the status command on all services described in the *SERVICE CONFIGURATION* directory.

*milkcheck* cron status::
    Launch the status command on cron service described in the *SERVICE CONFIGURATION* directory.

*milkcheck* -s cron status::
    Do the same as above but give a summary at the end of the execution.

*milkcheck* -v status::
    Increase verbosity.

*milkcheck* -X cron status::
    Launch the status command on all services described in the *SERVICE CONFIGURATION* directory excepting the cron service.

*milkcheck* -n node1 status::
    Launch the status command on all services described in the *SERVICE CONFIGURATION* directory but only on node1 if present in the target field of the service.

*milkcheck* -x node1 status::
    Launch the status command on all services described in the *SERVICE CONFIGURATION* directory but not node1.

*milkcheck* --define "foo=bar" start::
    Launch the start command on all services, and defined, for this run only, the global variable 'foo' to 'bar'.

*milkcheck* --tags "foo,bar" start::
    Launch the start command on all services matching tags 'foo' and 'bar'.
