# Delegated mode
# Apply.   service, actions
# Default. standard

# "mode: [standard, delegate]"
#
# This mode uses a service with target, but command is run locally.
# Milkcheck will manage the target like a distant service and so
# all command line argument like -w or -x will be applied to target.
# If this results into an empty target, no command will be run.
# This is intended for commands which handle their own connection.

# Action aliases
#
# You can declare multiple actions, separating action name with comma.
# This is useful to declare action name aliases, or if you combine it with
# automatic variables (see below).
# You can use a NodeSet-like syntax for action aliases (ie: change[01-10])
